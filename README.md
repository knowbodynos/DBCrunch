# ToricCY
Toric Calabi-Yau Threefold Generator and Database

Generates useful topological and geometric properties of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds constructed using toric methods on the Kreuzer-Skarke 4D reflexive polytope database.

Generation of properties is done in a modular way such that new properties can easily be added.

Intermediate steps and output both take the form of JSON files.
